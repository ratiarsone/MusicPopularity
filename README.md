# Popularity of Music Records - Machine Learning Project

## Executive Summary

Objective: To predict the likelihood of a song being a hit on the Billboard charts using a Kaggle dataset.

Approach and Structure:
- Neural Network Implementation using TensorFlow for benchmarking.
- Data Preprocessing for cleaning and standardizing features.
- Implementation of traditional Machine Learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, RandomForest, and K-Nearest Neighbors.
- Performance comparison using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Summary of Performance

- The neural network showed high precision but lower recall, suggesting a conservative model that may miss potential hits.
- Random Forest emerged as the superior model with robust performance across all metrics.
- Logistic Regression and SVM performed well in general classification tasks with comparable accuracy and F1-scores.
- Decision Tree had lower performance metrics, likely due to overfitting.
- K-Nearest Neighbors demonstrated effectiveness in identifying true positives with competitive recall.

## Conclusion

The project demonstrated a comprehensive approach, starting with a neural network and followed by traditional machine learning models. This allowed for an in-depth understanding of different algorithms' strengths and limitations in the context of song popularity prediction.
